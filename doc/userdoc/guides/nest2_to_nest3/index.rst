All about NEST 3.0
==================

NEST 3.0 introduces a more direct approach to accessing node properties and handling connections. The changes will allow you to
perform operations that were not possible in previous versions.

.. admonition:: Python 3

   With NEST 3.0, we no longer support Python 2. Running the code snippets throughout this guide requires a freshly
   started instance of Python (and sometimes pyplot from matplotlib). Check out our :doc:`Installation instructions <../../installation/linux_install>` for more
   information on the dependencies.
